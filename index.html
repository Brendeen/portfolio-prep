    <p class="intro">
      I'm new to the coding/tech world and I want to make my mark by creating inteeresting and useful
      applications for everyday use. My dream job is to work in a low stress enviroment surrounded by developers I can learn
      from and become close with, learning from eachother to better everyone. Anything nerdy is up my alley, from anime, video games,
      comics, working in a fun nerdy company would be the perfect place for me!

    <p class="pitch">
      "I am a recent graduate of Code Fellows bootcamp looking to get into the tech industry. Unlike most grads of Code Fellows, I'm very new to this industry and the tech industry in general. I have previous experience in retail and customer service, which translates well into the tech industry, as it is primarily a team driven profession. What sets me apart from the others is my unrivaled creativity. Coming up with ideas and work arounds are key to keeping a steady flow during a project, as well as coming up with and incorperating ideas to better your project. Afterall, every project starts out as just an idea, and an idea starts with creativity."
