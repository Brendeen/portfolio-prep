    <p>
      Battle dice is a simple dice game where you put in some user info like your name and blood type, and role a dice against a bot to see who gets the higher roll. All previous rolls are displayed on the leaderboard through the use of local data.

      <p>
        Salmon Cookies was a lab done in week 2 of my 201 course. We made fake websites promoting our friend Pats new cookies and displayed data from all the stores using DOM manipulation in the form of a table. The user can even add new stores and cookie sale averages to see what the results would look like in other made up stores. This website was made using DOM manipulation and constructor functions.

    <p>
      Odd Duck Products was a very odd project dont in week 3 of my 201 course. The point of odd duck is to show the user a set of 3 images, and the user clicks on the one that appeals to them the most. The user picks 25 of their favorite products which are then displayed in a bar graph using the library chart.js. This website was made using librarys and local storage.
